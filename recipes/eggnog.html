        <li>2 cups Milk</li>
        <li>6 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cups Sugar</li>

      <h3>Extras</h3>

        with maple syrup or honey. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: inclusion of alcohol alongside allowing the eggnog to
        sit overnight is a good countermeasure against salmonella in 
        the unlikely event that the eggs contained it.
